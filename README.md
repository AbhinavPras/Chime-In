# Chime-In
Pattern Recognition Game on a STM-NucleoF401RE board
Primarily developed in C and a few Arduino Modules

Players choose a difficulty and repeat the sequence of colours that are randomly generated, by pressing the corresponding buttons

The sequences get longer and have a smaller time window to complete as the player progresses through the challenge
